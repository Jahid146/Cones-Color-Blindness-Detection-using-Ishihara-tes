          <h3><b>Understanding Color Vision:</b></h3>
          <p>
            Color vision is a complex aspect of visual perception. 
            Variations in color perception can be due to a range of factors, including genetics, eye health, and age. 
            Color blindness, or color vision deficiency, can manifest in different ways, from difficulty distinguishing specific colors to a complete inability to perceive certain hues.
